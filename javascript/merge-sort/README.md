## Whiteboard Process

No whiteboard was done for this assignment, an article was written instead, found [here](./BLOG.md)

## Approach & Efficiency

This approach has a fast run time with a Big O of O(n Log(n)) and it also has a space complexity of O(n).

## Solution

To see the code in action you can run the tests with `npm run test` or you can use `npm run code` to run the index file. The second option allows for you to try your own inputs within the index.js file.
