# Trees

## Challenges

Create a binary tree and a binary search tree with depth first searches and methods for addition.

## API

Binary Tree Methods:

- addNode(value to add): creates a new node, at the first open leaf in a level search.
- levelSearch: returns all the values of the tree level, by level reading left to right.
- preOrder: returns all the values of the tree in a depth first Pre Order pattern. 
- inOrder: returns all the values of the tree in a depth first In Order pattern. 
- postOrder: returns all the values of the tree in a depth first Post Order pattern.
- findMax: returns the highest numeric value in the tree.

Binsary Search Tree Methods:

- shares all above methods.
- add(value to add): adds a new node at the appropriate place per BST structure.
- contains(search value): returns a boolean identifying if the searched value is in the tree.
