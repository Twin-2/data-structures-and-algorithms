Write a function that sorts an array in place.

## Whiteboard Process

No whiteboard was done for this assignment, an article was written instead, found [here](./BLOG.md)

## Approach & Efficiency

This approach seems to be the best way to inplace sort an array but it does require a large amount of time.

The plus side is taht it does not require much space.

## Solution

To see the code in action you can run the tests with `npm run test` or you can use `npm run code` to run the index file. The second option allows for you to try your own inputs within the index.js file.
