# Challenge Summary

Write a function that sorts an array in place.

## Whiteboard Process

No whiteboard was done for this assignment, an article was written instead, found [here](./BLOG.md)

## Approach & Efficiency

This approach seems can be one of the most time effective sorting algorithms with a Big O time of O(nlogn). But it's worse case is O(n^2). However, by choosing a random pivot you can on average achieve the better time complexity, statistically.

## Solution

To see the code in action you can run the tests with `npm run test` or you can use `npm run code` to run the index file. The second option allows for you to try your own inputs within the index.js file.
